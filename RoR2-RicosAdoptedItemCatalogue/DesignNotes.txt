Goal: A shared health bar that all players redirect healing/damage to - if it dies, all players die

What counts as health?
- Player Health is obviously counted towards Team Health
- Player Shield has two options
  - it's counted just like Health is and can be healed like Health (S:H)
  - it's left on the player and takes damage before the Team Health (S:A)
- Player Barrier also has a few options
  - it's left on the player and takes damage before the Team Health (B:A)
  - it's treated like Healing is, and is used to heal the Team Health (B:H)

How is damage calculated in each above pattern? Assume 1000 damage dealt to player with 1000 Health, 500 Shield, and 100 Barrier
- S:H B:H - The Team Health takes 1000 damage, the Player Shield and Barrier do nothing to reduce this
- S:H B:A - The Team Health takes 900 damage, the Player Barrier collapses and the Shield does nothing (player can recharge Barrier)
- S:A B:H - The Team Health takes 500 damage, the Player Shield collapses and the Barrier does nothing (player can recharge Shield)
- S:A B:A - The Team Health takes 400 damage, the Player Shield and Barrier both collapse (player can recharge both)

Knowing that S:A B:A is the best option, how should each player handle Aegis Barrier?
- Option 1 is that it can recharge immediately since the player is still at full health
  - This would intercept all Healing from the player until they reach full Barrier (punishes the Team)
- Option 2 is that the team should wait until the Team Health is full to generate
  - This would prevent any Barrier recharge until the Team Health is full (punishes the Player)
- Option 3 is that the heal is split between the Team and player
  - Half(?) would go to the Player Barrier, the rest goes to Team Health
  - If either fills first, full send to the other (balanced, but probably doesn't feel great)

What about minions?
- Ghosts and Polyps take DoT, which would chew away at the Team Health unchecked
  - Seeing as both of these are already fairly poor items, maybe don't include them
- Purchased Turrets/Drones have high Regen values and suprising Health bulk early on
  - Hesitant to include these because of the Regen values
- Beetle Guards are fairly stable growth with a bit of Health bulk
  - ...but they're pretty dumb and are prone to take big hits or jump off cliffs (WeakAssKnees scales forever btw)
- Engi Turrets scale off the Engineer that placed them
  - They use the Suicide when redeployed, so there isn't a damage value for that (nor should there be)
  - Only because no other minions are include, also exclude these probably

What about status changes? Vultures/Dios/Tonic/Glass? What about levelling?
